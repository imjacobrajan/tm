# Device Roles & Classification Flow

## üéØ Overview

Device Roles & Classification is like having an **organizational chart system** for your network infrastructure. It automatically categorizes devices based on their characteristics and assigns appropriate roles, similar to how employees are assigned job titles and departments in a company.

## üè¢ Real-World Analogy

Think of Device Roles & Classification like **corporate job classification**:

1. **Job Analysis**: Analyze employee skills and responsibilities (device capabilities)
2. **Role Assignment**: Assign job titles and departments (device roles)
3. **Performance Expectations**: Set performance standards for each role (monitoring templates)
4. **Career Development**: Plan growth and development paths (device lifecycle)
5. **Organizational Structure**: Understand reporting relationships (network hierarchy)
