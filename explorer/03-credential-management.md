# Credential Management Flow

## üéØ Overview

Credential Management is like having a **master key system** for a large building complex. It manages all the different types of keys, access cards, and security credentials needed to access different parts of your network infrastructure.

## üè¢ Real-World Analogy

Think of credential management like a **security company** managing access to a corporate campus:

1. **Key Types**: Different keys for different buildings (SNMP, SSH, WMI)
2. **Access Levels**: Some keys work everywhere, others are restricted
3. **Priority System**: Master keys tried first, then specialized keys
4. **Security Zones**: Different credentials for different security areas
5. **Audit Trail**: Track which keys were used and when

## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Credential Creation
**What happens**: Create new authentication credentials for network devices
**Analogy**: Issuing new access cards for building employees

**Credential Types Available**:

#### SNMP Credentials
**SNMP v1/v2c** (Simple Access):
- **Community String**: Like a simple door code
- **Use Case**: Basic network devices, printers, simple switches
- **Security Level**: Low (plain text)
- **Example**: `community: "public"`

**SNMP v3** (Secure Access):
- **Username/Password**: Like a secure keycard system
- **Auth Protocol**: MD5, SHA, SHA-256 (encryption methods)
- **Priv Protocol**: DES, AES (privacy protection)
- **Use Case**: Critical network infrastructure
- **Security Level**: High (encrypted)

#### SSH Credentials
**Secure Shell Access**:
- **Username/Password**: Like secure building access
- **Key-based Auth**: Like biometric access (future enhancement)
- **Use Case**: Routers, switches, Linux servers
- **Security Level**: High (encrypted tunnel)

#### WMI Credentials
**Windows Management**:
- **Domain/Username**: Like corporate ID badges
- **Password**: Like PIN codes
- **Use Case**: Windows servers, workstations
- **Security Level**: Medium (domain authentication)

#### Cloud API Credentials
**Cloud Provider Access**:
- **AWS**: Access keys, secret keys
- **Azure**: Service principal, client secrets
- **Use Case**: Cloud resources, virtual machines
- **Security Level**: High (token-based)

### Step 2: Credential Configuration
**What happens**: Configure credential properties and scoping
**Analogy**: Setting up access permissions and restrictions

**Configuration Options**:

#### Basic Properties
- **Name**: Descriptive name for the credential
- **Type**: Protocol type (SNMP, SSH, WMI, etc.)
- **Priority**: Order of use (1 = highest priority)
- **Status**: Active/inactive

#### Authentication Details
**SNMP v1/v2c**:
- Community string
- Read/write permissions

**SNMP v3**:
- Username
- Authentication password
- Privacy password
- Auth protocol (MD5, SHA, etc.)
- Privacy protocol (DES, AES, etc.)
- Engine ID (optional)
- Context (optional)

**SSH/WMI**:
- Username
- Password
- Domain (for WMI)

#### Scoping Rules
**IP Range Scoping**:
- Define which IP ranges this credential applies to
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24` (only devices in this subnet)

**Device Type Scoping**:
- Restrict to specific device types
- Example: Only routers and switches

**Vendor Scoping**:
- Limit to specific vendors
- Example: Only Cisco devices

**OS Type Scoping**:
- Restrict to specific operating systems
- Example: Only Windows servers

**Role Scoping**:
- Limit to specific device roles
- Example: Only core network devices

### Step 3: Priority Management
**What happens**: Organize credentials by priority and usage order
**Analogy**: Organizing keys by importance and frequency of use

**Priority System**:
- **Priority 1**: Highest priority, tried first
- **Priority 2-10**: Decreasing priority
- **Auto-assignment**: System assigns priority based on success rate

**Priority Rules**:
1. **SNMP v3** credentials typically have higher priority than v1/v2c
2. **Specific credentials** have higher priority than generic ones
3. **Recently successful** credentials get higher priority
4. **Scoped credentials** have higher priority than global ones

### Step 4: Credential Testing
**What happens**: Test credentials against target devices
**Analogy**: Testing keys on different doors to see which ones work

**Testing Process**:
1. **Connection Test**: Attempt to connect using the credential
2. **Authentication Test**: Verify username/password/community
3. **Permission Test**: Check read/write access levels
4. **Response Validation**: Verify expected data is returned

**Test Results**:
- **Success**: Credential works, device accessible
- **Failure**: Credential rejected, try next priority
- **Partial**: Some access granted, limited functionality
- **Timeout**: Device not responding

### Step 5: Credential Assignment
**What happens**: Automatically assign working credentials to devices
**Analogy**: Giving each building its own set of working keys

**Assignment Process**:
1. **Discovery Phase**: Try all credentials during device discovery
2. **Success Tracking**: Record which credentials work for which devices
3. **Automatic Assignment**: Assign working credentials to devices
4. **Fallback Setup**: Configure backup credentials for redundancy

**Assignment Rules**:
- **Primary Credential**: First successful credential becomes primary
- **Backup Credentials**: Additional working credentials as backups
- **Role-based Assignment**: Assign credentials based on device roles
- **Location-based Assignment**: Assign credentials based on device location
