# Reachability Testing Flow

## üéØ Overview

Reachability Testing is like having a **network health checkup system** that continuously monitors whether devices can communicate with each other, similar to a medical monitoring system that checks if all organs are functioning properly.

## üè¢ Real-World Analogy

Think of Reachability Testing like a **hospital monitoring system**:

1. **Vital Signs**: Continuously check if patients (devices) are responsive
2. **Connectivity Tests**: Verify if different hospital departments can communicate
3. **Alert System**: Notify staff when something goes wrong
4. **Recovery Monitoring**: Track when patients recover
5. **Dependency Tracking**: Understand which departments depend on each other

## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Test Configuration
**What happens**: Set up reachability tests between devices
**Analogy**: Setting up monitoring equipment between hospital departments

**Configuration Options**:
- **Source Device**: Starting point for reachability test
- **Target Device**: Destination point for reachability test
- **Source IP**: Specific source IP address (optional)
- **Target IP**: Specific destination IP address (optional)
- **Test Protocol**: ICMP, TCP, UDP, or application-specific

**Test Parameters**:
- **Check Interval**: How often to perform tests (every 60 seconds)
- **Timeout**: How long to wait for response (30 seconds)
- **Max Retries**: Number of retry attempts (3 attempts)
- **Test Duration**: How long to run continuous testing

### Step 2: Dependency Configuration
**What happens**: Configure device dependencies for intelligent alerting
**Analogy**: Understanding which hospital departments depend on each other

**Dependency Options**:
- **Include Dependencies**: Consider device dependencies in analysis
- **Include Suppressed**: Show alerts that are suppressed by dependencies
- **Dependency Rules**: Define parent-child relationships
- **Suppression Logic**: How to handle dependent device failures

**Dependency Types**:
- **Parent-Child**: Core device failure affects access devices
- **Upstream-Downstream**: Network flow dependencies
- **Service Dependencies**: Application service dependencies
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Power, cooling, network dependencies

### Step 3: Test Execution
**What happens**: Perform reachability tests and collect results
**Analogy**: Running diagnostic tests between hospital departments

**Test Process**:
1. **Connection Attempt**: Try to reach target device
2. **Response Measurement**: Measure response time and success
3. **Retry Logic**: Retry failed attempts
4. **Result Recording**: Record test results and timestamps
5. **Status Update**: Update device and path status

**Test Methods**:
- **ICMP Ping**: Basic connectivity test
- **TCP Connect**: Port-specific connectivity
- **UDP Test**: UDP service availability
- **Application Test**: Application-specific protocols
- **SNMP Test**: Management protocol availability

### Step 4: Results Analysis
**What happens**: Analyze test results and determine reachability status
**Analogy**: Analyzing diagnostic results to determine patient health

**Analysis Factors**:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful tests
- **Response Time**: Average and maximum response times
- **Consistency**: Regularity of responses
- **Error Patterns**: Types and frequency of errors
- **Recovery Time**: Time to recover from failures

**Status Determination**:
- **Reachable**: Device responds consistently within timeout
- **Unreachable**: Device doesn't respond or times out
- **Intermittent**: Device responds sometimes but not consistently
- **Degraded**: Device responds but with high latency or errors

### Step 5: Continuous Monitoring
**What happens**: Set up ongoing reachability monitoring
**Analogy**: Continuous patient monitoring in ICU

**Monitoring Features**:
- **Scheduled Tests**: Regular automated testing
- **Event-driven Tests**: Tests triggered by network events
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Alert when metrics exceed thresholds
- **Trend Analysis**: Track reachability trends over time
- **Historical Data**: Store test results for analysis
