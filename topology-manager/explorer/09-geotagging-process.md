# Geotagging Process Flow

## üéØ Overview

Geotagging Process is like having a **global positioning system** for your network infrastructure. It adds precise location information to devices and sites, similar to how GPS coordinates are added to photos or how addresses are assigned to buildings.

## üè¢ Real-World Analogy

Think of Geotagging like **address assignment** in a city:

1. **Address Research**: Find the exact address for each building (device location)
2. **Coordinate Mapping**: Convert addresses to GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude)
3. **Verification**: Verify that addresses are correct and up-to-date
4. **Database Updates**: Update the city directory with new addresses
5. **Map Integration**: Show buildings on city maps with their addresses
